# novel-covid-19-LSTM-Analysis-ML-DeepLearning
Will use LSTM/DeepL to predict future confirmed cases of corona virus. This video is about code_rundown of analysis/prediction build for Corona-virus(Covid-19).  At first , will use some data preprocessing and analysis on the dataset obtained from kaggle, doing trend analysis with various plots,bar/graphs,etc  with world countries effected info in world map during this analysis is it proven that Covid-19 is pandemic which is what WHO also declared recently. and also china took some good measures so their rate of confirmed cases is deceased drastically compared to month earlier which are good signs,also saw Indian cases ,all these are subject to 11/03/20 as it is the latest date in the dataset(record).  Then in later part of video will predict for coming few dates how will be the confirmed rate/case w.r.t to world and obtain a graph plot with actual result to obtain error and accuracy perks. 
Following are some of the precautions prescribed by WHO::  1)Maintain social distancing
2)Wash your hands frequently 
3)Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth 
4)Practice respiratory hygiene 
5)If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early
